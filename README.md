# Co-Parametric Design

This is an example project integrating Autodesk Forge Viewer, Dynamo, and Grasshopper through Flux for demonstrating the idea of collaborative parametric design.

## Description

The system allows users to collaboratively do parametric design using visual programming tools including Dynamo and Grasshopper to edit Web-based Building Information Models (BIM) or general 3D models loaded in Autodesk Forge Viewer in a Web browser, without plug-ins. The project is supported by Autodesk Forge Research Grant and Flux.io.

The project samples and videos can be found in ["Project Report V5.pdf"](./Project Report V5.pdf). Online samples can be found at:
https://co-design.herokuapp.com

Here's an example:

![Two Computers sample](./images/two computers_v3.jpg?raw=true "Two Computers")

Two computers (representing two users collaborating on parametric modeling with visual programming tools). One computer controls the translation and scaling of the roof using Dynamo, and the other computer controls the rotation of the roof using Grasshopper. The models in Autodesk Viewer on the two computers are updated and synchronized, through Flux.

The videos are also available here:

1. The Viewer Extension sample for editing the building objects can be seen in the following video:
