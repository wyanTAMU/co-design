# Co-Design

Collaborative design system integrating Autodesk Forge Viewer, Dynamo, and Grasshopper through Flux

## Description

The system allows users to collaboratively do parametric design using visual programming tools including Dynamo and Grasshopper to edit Web-based Building Information Models (BIM) or general 3D models loaded in Autodesk Forge Viewer in a Web browser, without plug-ins. The project is supported by Autodesk Forge Research Grant and Flux.io.

The project samples and videos can be found in ["Project Report V5.docx"](./Project Report V5.docx). Online samples can be found at:
